/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*\
  This code has been adapted from the original AT&T public domain
  implementation of getopt(3).  The following comment comes from the original
  source, as posted to a newsgroup in 1987.

  The original SCCS ID attached to this code was:

	@(#)getopt.c	2.5 (smail) 9/15/87

  I have ANSI-fied this code and remove the #define of the `index' macro.
  In all other respects, it is identical to the original, posted source.

  This source file is not subject to the license in this directory; it is in
  the public domain.

/*
 * Here's something you've all been waiting for:  the AT&T public domain
 * source for getopt(3).  It is the code which was given out at the 1985
 * UNIFORUM conference in Dallas.  I obtained it by electronic mail
 * directly from AT&T.  The people there assure me that it is indeed
 * in the public domain.
 * 
 * There is no manual page.  That is because the one they gave out at
 * UNIFORUM was slightly different from the current System V Release 2
 * manual page.  The difference apparently involved a note about the
 * famous rules 5 and 6, recommending using white space between an option
 * and its first argument, and not grouping options that have arguments.
 * Getopt itself is currently lenient about both of these things White
 * space is allowed, but not mandatory, and the last option in a group can
 * have an argument.  That particular version of the man page evidently
 * has no official existence, and my source at AT&T did not send a copy.
 * The current SVR2 man page reflects the actual behavor of this getopt.
 * However, I am not about to post a copy of anything licensed by AT&T.
 *
 * ----
 * NOTE: To avoid conflicts with existing system getopt routines, I've
 * changed the names of the function and external variables from getopt(),
 * optind, etc., to x_getopt(), x_optind, etc.
 *
